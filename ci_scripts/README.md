# CI script

In order to use that script correctly, you need to set two env variables:

- FILE_PATH - The full path to bot python file you would like to upload to pythonanywere.com

- PYTHON_API_KEY - API key for access the pythoanywere.com

Please note, the uploaded file should contain fully working code with telegram token for TotahBotDev.
